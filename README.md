# tete-a-tetris
####An empty shell of a pairing problem

Four years ago when Jenna was just a wee JavaScripter, she wrote a Tetris in Canvas.

Jenna of today recently found this code and just burned most of it to the ground because it hurt her eyes. While the code was amazing for a wee JavaScripter, Jenna knows that it can be much better. But how?!

To be nice, she left some of it as a guide, but don't be afraid to burn that to the ground too...
